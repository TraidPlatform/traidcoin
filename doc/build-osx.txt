MacOS Traidd BUILD NOTES
===========================


See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Traid QT, the
graphical user interface.

Tested on MacOS High Sierra 10.13.2 - Darwin Kernel Version 17.3.0.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and
everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD
but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com


1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/traidcoin/traidcoin

2.  Install XCode and it's command line tools

3.  Download and install Homebrew from https://brew.sh/

4.  Install dependencies from Homebrew

brew install qt autoconf automake libtool boost@1.59 berkeley-db@4 openssl miniupnpc gmp

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
brew install qrencode

4.  Now you should be able to build Traidd:

cd Traid/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./Traidd --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./Traidd -daemon # to start the Traid daemon.
Run
  ./Traidd help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
