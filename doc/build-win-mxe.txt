WINDOWS MXE CROSS-COMPILING BUILD NOTES
=======================================

Basics
------

TraidCoin can be cross-compiled for Windows using MXE.
The following guide is the reference of MXE cross-compiling: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1080289.0


Configure environment
---------------------

The following is needed to build:
- Linux dependencies
- MXE
- Berkeley DB 5.3.28
- miniupnpc 1.6.20120509

The script scripts/configure-mxe.sh can be used to set up all the environment for a Debian/Ubuntu release.
The default path for the MXE environment is /mnt/mxe-build. You can change this path using the MXE_BASEPATH variable in the configure script.


Build
-----

The script scripts/build-win-mxe.sh can be used to build TraidCoin using MXE.
If you changed the path of the MXE environment, you will also need to change the MXE_PATH variable in the build script.


Notes
-----
- When switching between a Linux and a MXE build, you will need to use the scripts/clean.sh script to clean everything.
- In older Debian/Ubuntu releases, the package libssl1.0-dev needs to be replaced by libssl-dev
